Illegal instruction (core dumped)

In brief, the error will be thrown if weâ€™re running recent TensorFlow binaries on CPU(s) 
that do not support Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), an instruction set that enables faster
computation especially for vector operations. Starting from TensorFlow 1.6, pre-built
TensorFlow binaries use AVX instructions. An excerpt from TensorFlow 1.6 release announcement:
